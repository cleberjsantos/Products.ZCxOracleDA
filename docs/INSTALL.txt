Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``Products.ZCxOracleDA`` to the list of eggs to
   install ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        Products.ZCxOracleDA

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'ZMI' page in a Zope and click on the select box next to
''Products.ZCxOracleDA'' and click the 'Add' button.
