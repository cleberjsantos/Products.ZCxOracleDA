Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``Products.ZCxOracleDA`` to the list of eggs to
   install ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        Products.ZCxOracleDA

After updating the configuration you need to run ``bin/buildout``, which will
take care of updating your system.

Go to the ``ZMI`` page in a Zope and click on the select box next to
``Z CxOracle Database Connection`` and click the ``Add`` button (as you would create some DA instance).

After creating the instance, you should see the connector DA. When creating a
new ZSQL method you should be able to use this DA instance as connection id.


* a ZCxOracleDA instance can be used as a standard DA together with    ZSQL methods.  

**WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT USE ZSQL METHODS AND MAPPERS WITHIN THE SAME REQUEST!!!**

Mappers/Sessions and Connections (for ZSQL methods) are totally independent 
and have their own transaction. Mixing both would result in two distinct
transactions leading to unpredictable results.
