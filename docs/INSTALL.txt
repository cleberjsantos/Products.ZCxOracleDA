Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``Products.ZCxOracleDA`` to the list of eggs to
   install ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        Products.ZCxOracleDA

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'ZMI' page in a Zope and click on the select box next to
''Products.ZCxOracleDA'' and click the 'Add' button (as you would create some DA instance).

After creating the instance, you should see the connector DA. When creating a
new ZSQL method you should be able to use this DA instance as connection id.
